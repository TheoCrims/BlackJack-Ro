Casino games depend largely on chance and luck, but this is not 100% true for Blackjack. The Blackjack card game is part of this small group of games of chance in which the result can be influenced by the player's strategy and skills. Let's take the book counting strategy as an example. This is the most popular and often used to beat the House. Exactly because they work, casinos are working hard to detect the players they will use. It is not an illegal strategy, but the House will use every possible way to persuade you to give up the game. Blackjack is a game that obeys strict rules. If you apply them correctly and disciplined, you will reduce the House's advantage to less than 1%. The most advantageous combinations are a hand of 21 or 20. The third best hand is worth 11 because you can afford to draw or card with minimal risk. Many novice players lose the game because their goal is to get a hand worth 21, but this is not true. The goal of the bettor is to beat the House, ie to make a hand of value as close as possible to 21, but without exceeding it and this hand to be bigger than that of the dealer.
